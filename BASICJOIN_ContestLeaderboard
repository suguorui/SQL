/*
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the 
descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by 
ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.
